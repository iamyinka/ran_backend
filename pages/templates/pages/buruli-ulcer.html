                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Buruli - a puzzling disease

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Buruli ulcer is almost unknown in Europe. In West Africa, the “little sister” of
                                    leprosy is very widespread - and has
                                    hardly been researched.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Buruli ulcer is an insidious disease: it is caused by a bacterium that excretes a
                                    poison. This suppresses the immune
                                    defense. The pain is often only felt when the bacterium has already destroyed the
                                    skin and tissue down to the bone.
                                    Immediate antibiotic treatments are crucial in these stages of the disease. This
                                    kills the pathogen.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="details-title">What is Buruli Ulcer?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Buruli ulcer is caused by the leprosy bacterium related "Mycobacterium ulcerans".
                                    This secretes a toxin (mycolactone),
                                    which destroys the skin and tissue down to the bone. At the same time, the immune
                                    defense and the sensation of pain are
                                    suppressed. Because of the painlessness, but also because the disease is afflicted
                                    with a strong stigma in many places,
                                    the wounds are often hidden at first or are often only noticed by those affected
                                    when larger ulcers (open wounds) have
                                    already formed. Medical help is sought too late.

                                <h3 class="details-title">How is Buruli ulcer transmitted?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Although it was described over 100 years ago, the path of the infection is still
                                    unknown and accordingly there are no
                                    concrete measures to protect against infection. Buruli is unlikely to be transmitted
                                    from person to person. Since people
                                    often get sick near bodies of water, it is believed that an insect that needs water
                                    to live can transmit the disease.
                                    Why contact with standing water, e.g. during agricultural work, poses a risk of
                                    infection.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="details-title">What does the clinical picture look like?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The first symptoms of Buruli are small, non-painful lumps or lumps under the skin.
                                    Once inside the body, the bacteria
                                    often eat their way through skin, bones and other tissues on the arms and legs,
                                    creating large, flat, painless ulcers.
                                    When the disease is finally recognized, it has usually already caused great damage,
                                    similar to leprosy.

                                <p>Both the primary detection and treatment of Buruli ulcer require a very experienced
                                    team; an ulcer can often be
                                    diagnosed as a Buruli ulcer based on its appearance. In any case, however, the
                                    diagnostic evidence must be provided.
                                    This is done in specific laboratory tests, for which some tissue has to be removed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Today, these methods are so refined that antibiotic therapy can already determine
                                    whether the causative bacteria have
                                    been killed and healing can be expected.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="details-title">Is Buruli Ulcer Curable?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In principle, the disease is curable and is rarely fatal. Unfortunately, there is
                                    still no good and simple therapy. In
                                    the early stages of the disease, one can try to treat Buruli ulcer with a
                                    combination of antibiotics for eight weeks.
                                    Unfortunately, this treatment is often associated with serious side effects such as
                                    numbness.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If left untreated, serious complications can also occur, for example in the form of
                                    a stiffening of joints and severe
                                    contractures, if large ulcers extend over joints for a long time without treatment
                                    and thereby lead to the shrinking of
                                    the underlying tissue. Alternatively, one can try to surgically remove the Buruli
                                    ulcer over a large area. The resulting
                                    wounds heal very slowly and can become infected with other bacteria. If the Buruli
                                    ulcer heals, large scars remain,
                                    which often lead to restricted mobility and deformities on the arms and legs. These
                                    patients must undergo intensive
                                    physical therapy to restore joint function.

                                <p>
                                    The treatment of ulcers, in particular, is complicated and tedious. The following
                                    treatment measures are used:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>An elaborate wound care</li>
                                    <li>the administration of a combination of antibiotics against the pathogens</li>
                                    <li>surgical interventions</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Today, treatment begins with a combination of two antibiotics over a period of 8
                                    weeks. Due to many studies, this
                                    therapy is considered mandatory and has been established as a guideline by the WHO.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The initial drug treatment (antibiosis) ensures that either smaller ulcers heal
                                    completely or larger ulcers become
                                    significantly smaller; however, if tissue excision is necessary, this can be done to
                                    a much more limited extent. In this
                                    case, however, the smaller remaining wound - after often longer wound care - still
                                    has to be covered with a skin graft.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Until a few years ago, surgical therapy was the main focus of treatment: the ulcer
                                    was cut out, removing the visibly
                                    damaged tissue, and the wound was then covered with a skin graft.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The battle with Buruli ulcer can hardly be won with current resources. There is an
                                    urgent need for more research to
                                    develop better diagnosis and therapy and to discover suitable preventive measures.
                                </p>
