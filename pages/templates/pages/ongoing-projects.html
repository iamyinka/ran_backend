                                            Integrated service delivery (ISD) is imperative because fragmented
                                            delivery of single-disease services is not cost-efficient. With dwindling
                                            financial resources and
                                            associated poor health funding, fragmented services delivery is no longer
                                            sustainable. Nigeria’s
                                            fragile health system requires a service delivery model that will improve
                                            access, equity and
                                            patient outcomes. Overdependence on the few and inequitably distributed MH
                                            experts, and the
                                            huge MH treatment gap of &gt;80% all point to the need for ISD that expands
                                            equitable access to
                                            quality care, including the poorest and marginalized population groups.
